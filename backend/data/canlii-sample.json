    "body": "A negligence appeal concerning professional advice. The Court of Appeal reviewed the applicable duty of care framework, the Anns/Cooper test, and the proximity guidelines for professional auditors. After summarizing the factual matrix, including the consultations between Smith and Jones, the court held that the trial judge failed to analyze the foreseeability of economic harm. The decision also considers standard of review for mixed fact and law and clarifies the causation burden in negligent misrepresentation claims."
